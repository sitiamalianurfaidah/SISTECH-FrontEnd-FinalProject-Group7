         "Cybersecurity risk management guides a growing number of IT decisions. Cybersecurity risks continue to have critical impacts on overall IT risk modeling, assessment and mitigation.\nIn this course, you will learn about the general information security risk management framework and its practices and how to identify and model information security risks and apply both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. Understanding this framework will enable you to articulate the business consequences of identified information security risks. These skills are essential for any successful information security professional.\nThe goal of this course is to teach students the risk management framework with both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods that concentrate on the information security (IS) aspect of IT risks. The relationship between the IT risk and business value will be discussed through several industry case studies.\nFirst, you will learn about the principles of risk management and its three key elements: risk analysis, risk assessment and risk mitigation. You will learn to identify information security related threats, vulnerability, determine the risk level, define controls and safeguards, and conduct cost-benefit analysis or business impact analysis.\nSecond, we will introduce the qualitative and quantitative frameworks and discuss the differences between these two frameworks. You will learn the details of how to apply these frameworks in assessing information security risk.\nThird, we will extend the quantitative framework with data mining and machine learning approaches that are applicable for data-driven risk analytics. You will explore the intersection of information security, big data and artificial intelligence.\nFinally, you will analyze a series of extended case studies, which will help you to comprehend and generalize the principles, frameworks and analytical methods in actual examples.\nThis offering is part of the RITx Cybersecurity MicroMasters Program that prepares students to enter and advance in the field of computing security.",

We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses.

         "Want to know how to avoid bad decisions with data?\nMaking good decisions with data can give you a distinct competitive advantage in business. This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.\nThese big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.\nWe will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?\nThis course will be is relevant for anyone eager to have a framework for good decision-making. It will be good preparation for students with a bachelor's degree contemplating graduate study in a business field.\nOpportunities in analytics are abundant at the moment. Specific techniques or software packages may be helpful in landing first jobs, but those techniques and packages may soon be replaced by something newer and trendier. Understanding the ways in which quantitative models really work, however, is a management level skill that is unlikely to go out of style.\nThis course is part of the Business Principles and Entrepreneurial Thought XSeries.",

Financial decisions made by individuals impact the larger community in significant ways with pervasive cost due to financial mistakes. A recent study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reveals over 50% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. In addition, over 50% of Americans have no emergency fund, unable to cope with an unexpected car repair without borrowing funds. Financial literacy is an urgent need for many.\nThis course dives deeply into issues and decisions that impact your financial future. You’ll explore strategies around controlling and managing risk, planning for retirement, and cultivating an investment mindset. Through a hands-on approach, you’ll gain answers to common personal financial questions including:\n\nWhat exactly is risk, and why should I care about it?\nWhat are the core concepts and principles of insurance?\nHow do insurance companies help consumers manage risk?\nDo I need to buy life insurance and how much?\nWhat are my family’s needs for security from loss of life and property?\nWhat are my options for life insurance?\nWhat are good decisions that both save money and protect me from reasonable risks?\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance, or can I save money with liability insurance?\nHow much money do I need in retirement, and how do I determine my needs?\nWhere can I look for sources of income in retirement?\nAm I ready both financially and philosophically to be an investor?\nWhat are the risks of investing, and am I ready to accept them?\nHow do I allocate my investments depending upon the stage of my life?\n\nThrough course videos, selected short readings, and self-paced activities, students in this course will gain both practical knowledge of core concepts of risk, retirement, and investment, and a broader view of the role of planning plays in our quest for financial and personal satisfaction.",

In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.\nThese courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:\nData Analysis for Life Sciences:\n\nPH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences\nPH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra\nPH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments\nPH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis\n\nGenomics Data Analysis:\n\nPH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor\nPH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics\nPH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor\n\nThis class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.",

         "Cybersecurity risk management guides a growing number of IT decisions. Cybersecurity risks continue to have critical impacts on overall IT risk modeling, assessment and mitigation.\nIn this course, you will learn about the general information security risk management framework and its practices and how to identify and model information security risks and apply both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. Understanding this framework will enable you to articulate the business consequences of identified information security risks. These skills are essential for any successful information security professional.\nThe goal of this course is to teach students the risk management framework with both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods that concentrate on the information security (IS) aspect of IT risks. The relationship between the IT risk and business value will be discussed through several industry case studies.\nFirst, you will learn about the principles of risk management and its three key elements: risk analysis, risk assessment and risk mitigation. You will learn to identify information security related threats, vulnerability, determine the risk level, define controls and safeguards, and conduct cost-benefit analysis or business impact analysis.\nSecond, we will introduce the qualitative and quantitative frameworks and discuss the differences between these two frameworks. You will learn the details of how to apply these frameworks in assessing information security risk.\nThird, we will extend the quantitative framework with data mining and machine learning approaches that are applicable for data-driven risk analytics. You will explore the intersection of information security, big data and artificial intelligence.\nFinally, you will analyze a series of extended case studies, which will help you to comprehend and generalize the principles, frameworks and analytical methods in actual examples.\nThis offering is part of the RITx Cybersecurity MicroMasters Program that prepares students to enter and advance in the field of computing security.",

In Statistics.com’s MLOps with AWS program you will learn to combine data engineering and data science skills to deploy machine learning models.\nMost of the work in deploying AI models does not lie in developing models.  Rather, it lies in developing, monitoring and maintaining an automated, self-monitoring data pipeline through a model and into actions.  The common practice of tossing a project back and forth between pure data scientists and pure data engineers leads to delay and errors.  This has created a need for AI engineers who have knowledge of each function. Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Amazon Web Services platform is a sure path to career success.\nIn this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed.\nYou will focus on developing the skills needed to create an AWS  pipeline that:\r\n\nIngests data to train a predictive model\nFeeds the model as it operates\nScores the data on an ongoing basis\nOutputs an action\nIntegrates into business applications\n\nAdditionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering.

         "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is the core of AI Engineering.  In this program, you will learn the tangible data engineering and data science skills needed to deploy machine learning models via GCP.",
         "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lies at the core of the AI Engineering function. In Statistics.com’s MLOps with GCP program you will learn to combine data engineering and data science skills to deploy machine learning models.\nMost of the work in deploying AI models does not lie in developing models.  Rather, it lies in developing, monitoring and maintaining an automated, self-monitoring data pipeline through a model and into actions. The common practice of tossing a project back and forth between pure data scientists and pure data engineers leads to delay and errors.  This has created a need for AI engineers who have knowledge of each function. Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Google Cloud platform is a sure path to career success.\nIn this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed.\nYou will focus on developing the skills needed to create a GCP pipeline that:\r\n\nIngests data to train a predictive model\nFeeds the model as it operates\nScores the data on an ongoing basis\nOutputs an action\nIntegrates into business applications\n\nAdditionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering. Elder Research leverages the wisdom gained by solving a wide variety of real-world problems to infuse their education programs on the Statistics.com platform with the most cutting-edge training that can be applied day one.",

         "Planning for Risk, Retirement and Investment is made possible by the Brian and Sheila Jellison Family Foundation.\nThe Planning for Risk, Retirement & Investment course is designed for individuals to build financial literacy, one of the most pressing needs Americans face today. Financial decisions made by individuals impact the larger community in significant ways with pervasive cost due to financial mistakes. A recent study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reveals over 50% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. In addition, over 50% of Americans have no emergency fund, unable to cope with an unexpected car repair without borrowing funds. Financial literacy is an urgent need for many.\nThis course dives deeply into issues and decisions that impact your financial future. You’ll explore strategies around controlling and managing risk, planning for retirement, and cultivating an investment mindset. Through a hands-on approach, you’ll gain answers to common personal financial questions including:\n\nWhat exactly is risk, and why should I care about it?\nWhat are the core concepts and principles of insurance?\nHow do insurance companies help consumers manage risk?\nDo I need to buy life insurance and how much?\nWhat are my family’s needs for security from loss of life and property?\nWhat are my options for life insurance?\nWhat are good decisions that both save money and protect me from reasonable risks?\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance, or can I save money with liability insurance?\nHow much money do I need in retirement, and how do I determine my needs?\nWhere can I look for sources of income in retirement?\nAm I ready both financially and philosophically to be an investor?\nWhat are the risks of investing, and am I ready to accept them?\nHow do I allocate my investments depending upon the stage of my life?\n\nThrough course videos, selected short readings, and self-paced activities, students in this course will gain both practical knowledge of core concepts of risk, retirement, and investment, and a broader view of the role of planning plays in our quest for financial and personal satisfaction.",

         "Project risk management involves identifying, assessing, quantifying, modeling, and managing risks that may face a project. Complex projects face the challenge of accurately estimating costs and completion times, or even of failing to deliver outcomes as planned. Even the simplest projects always have some element of risk.\nWays are needed to identify and manage risks to prevent project failure. A risk plan is the way to lessen the chance of adverse outcomes.\nThe project risk management plan is the fundamental instrument for identifying elements and activities of project risk management, establishing risk breakdown structures, quantifying the extent of risk, and planning a mitigation strategy.\nThe initial step in planning for project risk management is developing the risk register. A risk register is a detailed inventory of things that could go wrong. The risk register provides a plan to follow the project through completion.\nAssigning probabilities and consequences to the many items in the risk register is in itself challenging. Contemporary lessons from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics provide insights into how to do so.\nFinally, the project manager must consider the best responses to risk including how to avoid, mitigate, plan contingencies, or transfer the risk.

         "Cybersecurity risk management guides a growing number of IT decisions. Cybersecurity risks continue to have critical impacts on overall IT risk modeling, assessment and mitigation.\nIn this course, you will learn about the general information security risk management framework and its practices and how to identify and model information security risks and apply both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. Understanding this framework will enable you to articulate the business consequences of identified information security risks. These skills are essential for any successful information security professional.\nThe goal of this course is to teach students the risk management framework with both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods that concentrate on the information security (IS) aspect of IT risks. The relationship between the IT risk and business value will be discussed through several industry case studies.\nFirst, you will learn about the principles of risk management and its three key elements: risk analysis, risk assessment and risk mitigation. You will learn to identify information security related threats, vulnerability, determine the risk level, define controls and safeguards, and conduct cost-benefit analysis or business impact analysis.\nSecond, we will introduce the qualitative and quantitative frameworks and discuss the differences between these two frameworks. You will learn the details of how to apply these frameworks in assessing information security risk.\nThird, we will extend the quantitative framework with data mining and machine learning approaches that are applicable for data-driven risk analytics. You will explore the intersection of information security, big data and artificial intelligence.\nFinally, you will analyze a series of extended case studies, which will help you to comprehend and generalize the principles, frameworks and analytical methods in actual examples.\nThis offering is part of the RITx Cybersecurity MicroMasters Program that prepares students to enter and advance in the field of computing security.",

We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.\nThese courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:\nData Analysis for Life Sciences:\n\nPH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences\nPH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra\nPH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments\nPH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis\n\nGenomics Data Analysis:\n\nPH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor\nPH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics\nPH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor\n\nThis class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.",

Financial decisions made by individuals impact the larger community in significant ways with pervasive cost due to financial mistakes. A recent study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reveals over 50% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. In addition, over 50% of Americans have no emergency fund, unable to cope with an unexpected car repair without borrowing funds. Financial literacy is an urgent need for many.\nThis course dives deeply into issues and decisions that impact your financial future. You’ll explore strategies around controlling and managing risk, planning for retirement, and cultivating an investment mindset. Through a hands-on approach, you’ll gain answers to common personal financial questions including:\n\nWhat exactly is risk, and why should I care about it?\nWhat are the core concepts and principles of insurance?\nHow do insurance companies help consumers manage risk?\nDo I need to buy life insurance and how much?\nWhat are my family’s needs for security from loss of life and property?\nWhat are my options for life insurance?\nWhat are good decisions that both save money and protect me from reasonable risks?\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance, or can I save money with liability insurance?\nHow much money do I need in retirement, and how do I determine my needs?\nWhere can I look for sources of income in retirement?\nAm I ready both financially and philosophically to be an investor?\nWhat are the risks of investing, and am I ready to accept them?\nHow do I allocate my investments depending upon the stage of my life?\n\nThrough course videos, selected short readings, and self-paced activities, students in this course will gain both practical knowledge of core concepts of risk, retirement, and investment, and a broader view of the role of planning plays in our quest for financial and personal satisfaction.",

         "Business analytics is the ability to collate and combine multiple streams of data to better understand business processes, customer demands, and relationships between multiple agents.\nWe live and work in an uncertain world. Every day, business managers, economists, line managers, supervisors and front-line workers must make decisions and predictions based on limited information. This program will help you to make better informed decisions for the future to answer questions like:\r\n\nWhat is the probability that a staff member will need more than 20 days of sick leave in a year?\nDoes the new system for preparing food for customers offer a significant improvement over the old system, or is it the same?\nHow are sales likely to fluctuate over the next 12 months, based on trends in historical data?\n\n\nTo inform strategic decisions and remain competitive, businesses must leverage the insights contained in the large volumes of data produced both within the business and in the broader business environment. Providing you with skills that are highly sought after in the global workplace, this program will equip you with the analytical know-how needed to extract meaning from complex data sets and translate this meaning into actionable insights. \nThis program covers a variety of techniques applicable to the collection, presentation, interpretation, and use of numerical data. It provides a foundation for understanding statistical procedures that will help you undertake solid statistical analysis in business and economic situations. This includes statistical inference, probability & sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis tests, correlation & regression, experimental design, sample survey design, quality sampling, and modern business decision theory.",

We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses.

You’ll explore strategies around controlling and managing risk, planning for retirement, and cultivating an investment mindset. Through a hands-on approach, you’ll gain answers to common personal financial questions including:\n\nWhat exactly is risk, and why should I care about it?\nWhat are the core concepts and principles of insurance?\nHow do insurance companies help consumers manage risk?\nDo I need to buy life insurance and how much?\nWhat are my family’s needs for security from loss of life and property?\nWhat are my options for life insurance?\nWhat are good decisions that both save money and protect me from reasonable risks?\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance, or can I save money with liability insurance?\nHow much money do I need in retirement, and how do I determine my needs?\nWhere can I look for sources of income in retirement?\nAm I ready both financially and philosophically to be an investor?\nWhat are the risks of investing, and am I ready to accept them?\nHow do I allocate my investments depending upon the stage of my life?\n\nThrough course videos, selected short readings, and self-paced activities, students in this course will gain both practical knowledge of core concepts of risk, retirement, and investment, and a broader view of the role of planning plays in our quest for financial and personal satisfaction.",

         "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lies at the core of the AI Engineering function. In Statistics.com’s MLOps with AWS program you will learn to combine data engineering and data science skills to deploy machine learning models.\nMost of the work in deploying AI models does not lie in developing models.  Rather, it lies in developing, monitoring and maintaining an automated, self-monitoring data pipeline through a model and into actions.  The common practice of tossing a project back and forth between pure data scientists and pure data engineers leads to delay and errors.  This has created a need for AI engineers who have knowledge of each function. Mastering machine learning deployment skills on the Amazon Web Services platform is a sure path to career success.\nIn this course, you will learn how to work with data scientists to deploy machine learning models that can learn from data, and generate predictions, recommendations or decisions.  This process usually is automated and that is where MLOps and AI engineering skills are needed.\nYou will focus on developing the skills needed to create an AWS  pipeline that:\r\n\nIngests data to train a predictive model\nFeeds the model as it operates\nScores the data on an ongoing basis\nOutputs an action\nIntegrates into business applications\n\nAdditionally, you will learn to develop the pipeline so that it will continuously monitor several points of operation, including the incoming data (for data drift) and the decision outputs (for anomalies).\r\nStatistics.com is the training platform of Elder Research (elderresearch.com), an internationally recognized data analytics consulting firm that, since 1995, has consulted for hundreds of leading businesses in data strategy, data science, and data engineering.

         "Planning for Risk, Retirement and Investment is made possible by the Brian and Sheila Jellison Family Foundation.\nThe Planning for Risk, Retirement & Investment course is designed for individuals to build financial literacy, one of the most pressing needs Americans face today. Financial decisions made by individuals impact the larger community in significant ways with pervasive cost due to financial mistakes. A recent study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reveals over 50% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. In addition, over 50% of Americans have no emergency fund, unable to cope with an unexpected car repair without borrowing funds. Financial literacy is an urgent need for many.\nThis course dives deeply into issues and decisions that impact your financial future. You’ll explore strategies around controlling and managing risk, planning for retirement, and cultivating an investment mindset. Through a hands-on approach, you’ll gain answers to common personal financial questions including:\n\nWhat exactly is risk, and why should I care about it?\nWhat are the core concepts and principles of insurance?\nHow do insurance companies help consumers manage risk?\nDo I need to buy life insurance and how much?\nWhat are my family’s needs for security from loss of life and property?\nWhat are my options for life insurance?\nWhat are good decisions that both save money and protect me from reasonable risks?\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance, or can I save money with liability insurance?\nHow much money do I need in retirement, and how do I determine my needs?\nWhere can I look for sources of income in retirement?\nAm I ready both financially and philosophically to be an investor?\nWhat are the risks of investing, and am I ready to accept them?\nHow do I allocate my investments depending upon the stage of my life?\n\nThrough course videos, selected short readings, and self-paced activities, students in this course will gain both practical knowledge of core concepts of risk, retirement, and investment, and a broader view of the role of planning plays in our quest for financial and personal satisfaction.",

Complex projects face the challenge of accurately estimating costs and completion times, or even of failing to deliver outcomes as planned.

A risk plan is the way to lessen the chance of adverse outcomes.\nThe project risk management plan is the fundamental instrument for identifying elements and activities of project risk management, establishing risk breakdown structures, quantifying the extent of risk, and planning a mitigation strategy.\nThe initial step in planning for project risk management is developing the risk register. A risk register is a detailed inventory of things that could go wrong. The risk register provides a plan to follow the project through completion.\nAssigning probabilities and consequences to the many items in the risk register is in itself challenging. Contemporary lessons from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics provide insights into how to do so.\nFinally, the project manager must consider the best responses to risk including how to avoid, mitigate, plan contingencies, or transfer the risk.
